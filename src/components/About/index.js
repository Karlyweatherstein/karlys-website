          Hello! My name is Karly and I love all things creative! Throughout my
          schooling I never really knew what I wanted to do in life; all I knew
          was I liked creating things. All kinds of things, traditional pen and
          paper, paint, clay, printmaking, and digital. College truly opened my
          eyes to all of the possibilities. I was exposed to all kinds of
          different mediums. That is where I took my first digital media class
          and found playing around in computer programs to be so fun and
          rewarding. I graduated with a bachelors in fine art but still had no
          clue what to do with that. I was freelancing with my art but I needed
          more and one day stumbled upon coding. I thought it was so
          interesting; using code to create and design web applications. I used
          some of the free resources out there to play around with it and what
          do you know? I loved it.
          <br />

          Fast forward to me researching online programs and bootcamps and found
          out the university I attended was offering a bootcamp that started in
          a month. I signed up as fast as I could and spent every waking second
          practicing my new found love of using technology to be creative. I was
          trained in the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js! I
          have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as many other languages
          and libraries. Make sure to checkout my resume section for all of my
          experience!
